(2) To Fix the Last Commit Message

          git commit --amend -m "Add correct message"
          git push --force

    (Q) Why are we not specifying branch name?
        - Default Behavior: When no branch is specified, Git assumes you're pushing to the branch you have currently checked out (i.e., the branch you're actively working on).
        - If you want to explicitly specify the branch you're pushing to, you can include it in the command like this:

          git push --force origin <branch-name>

(3) To view all git branches

	- git branch -a
